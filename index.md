      Technical Overview
    </h2>
    <div style="font-size: 1.35rem; color: #333; text-align: justify;">
      The <b>sROBOTV1</b> is a sophisticated <b>seven-axis</b> robotic manipulator engineered to overcome the inherent limitations of traditional industrial kinematics. Most standard robotic arms utilize a 6-axis configuration, which often suffers from "mathematical singularities"—specific joint orientations where the arm loses a degree of freedom and becomes momentarily immobile in certain directions. 
      <br><br>
      By integrating a <b>redundant 7th axis</b>, the sROBOTV1 introduces "elbow redundancy." This architectural choice allows the arm to reach around environmental obstacles and navigate tight workspaces while keeping the end-effector (gripper) perfectly stationary. This level of dexterity is critical for advanced manipulation tasks, providing the robot with a human-like range of motion that can access complex geometric positions previously considered impossible for desktop-scale systems. The 7-axis design ensures that the workspace is not just larger, but fundamentally more usable for high-precision applications.

      Mechanical Integrity & Error Mitigation
    </h2>
    <div style="font-size: 1.3rem; color: #444; line-height: 1.9;">
      The primary challenge in long-reach robotic engineering is the management of <b>cumulative error propagation</b>. Through rigorous testing of the sROBOTV1 prototype, it was identified that the structural integrity of the base is the single most critical factor in system accuracy. 
      <br><br>
      Due to the mechanical leverage of a multi-segment arm, a microscopic <b>1-degree of deflection</b> or "play" at the foundation is amplified exponentially as it travels through the kinematic chain. By the time this deviation reaches the gripper side, it manifests as a massive, unpredictable displacement that compromises sub-millimeter precision. 
      <br><br>
      To neutralize these forces, the sROBOTV1 features a "bearing-dense" design philosophy. <b>Precision ball bearings have been integrated into nearly every moving joint</b> and structural junction throughout the entire 7-axis assembly. By replacing standard bushings or direct-fit plastic interfaces with high-grade steel bearings, the design achieves near-zero friction and absolute zero structural wobble. This ensures that the arm remains rigid and highly repeatable under load, providing industrial-grade stability in a compact, accessible form factor. Every rotation is smooth, and every joint is locked against lateral movement, resulting in a system that maintains its calibration even through high-speed maneuvers.

  <!-- SECTION 3: Final Design Philosophy -->
  <section style="max-width: 950px; margin: 0 auto 100px auto;">
    <div style="font-size: 1.35rem; color: #333; text-align: justify;">
      The <b>sROBOTV1</b> project proves that professional-grade robotics can be achieved through thoughtful mechanical optimization. By prioritizing joint rigidity and kinematic redundancy, this arm serves as a powerful platform for research into motion planning, obstacle avoidance, and high-precision automation.
